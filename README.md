# Weather App

A weather app showing the current temperature in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland and how it feels + a 5 day forecast.


## The problem

This is my first time working with an API and it was a really cool project but it was also one of the more frustrating ones. 
I think my main problem was how I structured the website in the HTML.

If I had more time I would figure out how to change the background depending on if it is night or day. I would move the temperature and 'Feels like' apart so there was space in the middle.
