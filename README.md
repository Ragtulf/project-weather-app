# Weather App 🌤💦❄️

A weather app showing the current temperature in Reykjavík, Iceland and how it feels + a 5 day forecast using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/)


## Tech

- JavaScript
- API
- JSON
- Flexbox
- CSS
- HTML

## How I did it

This is my first time working with an API and JSON and it was a really cool project but it was also one of the more frustrating ones. 

I think my main problem was how I structured the website in the HTML.
